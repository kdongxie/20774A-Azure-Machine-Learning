> Lab Scenario
>
> You work as a data scientist for Adatum Consultants. The company provides machine
> learning services and advice to help clients understand and visualize their
> data, discover patterns and correlations, and determine the optimum ways to
> present the data to be consumed by users and applications. You will be using
> Machine Learning with your clients, so to familiarize yourself with this
> environment, you need to start by creating a Machine Learning Studio workspace,
> and then exploring a sample machine learning model.

>Lab Review
>
>How would you explain to someone who is not a data scientist the significance of
>the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles you looked at in the sample experiment?
>From your own experience, can you think of another application for the Quantile
>Regression model that you looked at in the sample experiment?
